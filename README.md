URL Embed Module For Drupal 8

Project Description: This module should be the defacto way to embed an URL using WYSIWYG or a link field. This module will deprecate the ['oembed' module for Drupal 7] (https://www.drupal.org/project/oembed). This module will use the API provided by the 'Embed' module, which is also incidentally another GSoC project for this year but that should not obstruct the its development, at least in the initial stages.

Architecture discussion for this module can be found here: URL Embed Module. Finer details are not finalized yet but you should be able to get an idea of its basic structure.

If you're interested in this project, have any issues or want to discuss any of the aspects, feel free to ping 'cs_shadow' or 'davereid' or 'slashrsm' in '#drupal-google' or in '#drupal-media'.

Project Goal: Develop 'URL embed' module for Drupal 8 which deprecates 'oembed' module for Drupal 7 and utilizes the APIs provided by 'Embed' module.
